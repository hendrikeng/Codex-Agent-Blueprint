## Product Objective

- Deliver reliable operator workflows with explicit domain correctness.
- Favor clear user outcomes over speculative feature breadth.

## Decision Heuristics

- Prefer changes that improve correctness, observability, and operator confidence.
- Avoid new complexity without measurable product value.
- Keep domain terminology and UX behavior consistent.

## Domain Outcomes

- Faster and safer completion of core workflows.
- Reduced ambiguity in state transitions.
- Lower operational risk in sensitive paths.

## Prioritization Rules

- Correctness and safety before convenience.
- Resolve production-impacting issues before incremental polish.
- Keep documentation and behavior aligned in the same change.
