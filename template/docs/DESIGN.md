## Design Intent

- Clarity-first UI for high-stakes workflows.
- Consistent patterns across shared components.
- Accessible defaults in interaction and content.

## Design Principles

- Keep flows explicit and reversible where possible.
- Surface state, errors, and constraints clearly.
- Reuse canonical UI primitives instead of forking.

## Workspace Pattern

- Domain screens should follow shared layout and state patterns.
- Data-heavy views must preserve readability and hierarchy.

## Accessibility and UX Baseline

- Keyboard and focus behavior must be intentional.
- Color contrast must remain readable.
- Loading/error/empty states must be defined.
