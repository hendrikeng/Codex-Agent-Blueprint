# Evidence Index

Purpose: Canonical, plan-scoped evidence references after curation/completion.

## Usage

- Each completed plan should point `Done-Evidence` to `docs/exec-plans/evidence-index/<plan-id>.md`.
- Each index file is the compact source for retained evidence links.

## Indexed Plans

- none

## Policy

- Evidence is curated to keep useful, non-redundant information.
- Repeated unchanged blocker reruns are collapsed by strict-upsert policy.
